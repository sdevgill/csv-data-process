1. What is your favourite programming language and why?

My favorite programming language is Python because it is a very versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from web development and data analysis to scientific computing and machine learning. It has a clean and intuitive syntax that is easy to read and write, and a large and active community that provides a wealth of libraries, frameworks, and resources for developers.

2. Which cloud service provider is your favourite and why?
For personal projects, Digital Ocean.
It offers a wide range of high-quality services at an affordable price.
Their user-friendly interface makes it easy to set up and manage your virtual servers, and their global network ensures fast and reliable performance. Additionally, their customer support is always available to assist with any questions or issues that may arise. Overall, Digital Ocean provides an excellent balance of features and value for anyone looking for a reliable cloud provider.

3. What is your preferred approach to testing software?
My preferred approach to testing software is to first create a comprehensive test plan that outlines all of the key functionalities and features of the software. This plan should include a list of test cases and scenarios that cover a wide range of potential user behaviors and interactions with the software.
Once the test plan is in place, I would then execute the tests systematically, starting with the most important and critical functionalities and working my way down to the less important ones. I would use a combination of manual testing and automated testing tools to ensure that all of the test cases are executed accurately and efficiently.
Throughout the testing process, I would also be monitoring the software's performance and stability, and would be looking for any potential bugs or issues that need to be addressed. Once the testing is complete, I would then document the results of the tests and provide a detailed report to the development team.

4. Please provide your views and any relevant experience you have with devops, including web and mobile CI/CD:
I have experience with implementing DevOps practices, such as continuous integration and deployment, automated testing, and infrastructure as code. I have also worked on improving collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.
In terms of CI/CD, I have found it to be incredibly useful for automating the build, testing, and deployment processes, allowing for faster feedback and easier identification of potential issues. For example, I have implemented automated testing and deployment pipelines using tools such as Jenkins and GitHub, which have greatly improved the speed and reliability of our deployments.

5. What are the three most important things to you about your next project or role you undertake?
The ability to make a positive impact on the company and the world.
The opportunity to learn and grow professionally.
The alignment of the project or role with my personal values and goals.
